# remembrall-bot

Remembrall is a Facebook chat bot that lets you remember things using the [Leitner system][leitner].

Populate a deck with a list of questions and answers. Then, Remembrall will quiz you throughout the day to make sure you remember your stuff. If you get the question right, Remembrall will quiz you later. If not, Remembrall will quiz you again soon.

It's great for learning if you can't get off Messenger!
